    <h1>About Faylynn</h1

    }
    <p> My name is Faylynn Vidrio, I'm from the Bay Area, California. I love to travel and meet new people. I have decided to attend URI in hopes of personal growth and making lots of fun memories. I have a dog named Ollie, a cat named Venus, and four chickens back home. I enjoy going out with friends, going to concerts, spending time with family, or reading on a rainy day. I chose to major in computer science with a minor in business because I have always had an interest in both these fields. I hope to make the most out of my time here at URI and am excited to see what the future holds.</p>
